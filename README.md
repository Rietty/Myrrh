# Myrrh

In a forgotten land buried beneath centuries of ash, a city of the dead whispers your name. You are a bearer of Myrrh, a sacred resin said to anoint gods and trap souls. It binds you to the underworldâ€”neither dead nor living, you must descend again and again, gathering remnants of lost memory, sealing ancient grief, and unraveling the mystery of your own constant resurrection.
